# Manually curated annotations TSV file
#
# This runs as the final step in the curate chain. If possible, please
# put hardcoded annotations in an annotations file specific to a relevant
# curation layer. For instance, lineage annotatoins should not go in this
# file but rather `defaults/lineages.tsv`
#
#
# This TSV should not have a header and should have exactly three columns:
# COLUMN 1: (CURATED) STRAIN NAME
# COLUMN 2: FIELD NAME (e.g. date)
# COLUMN 3: NEW VALUE (e.g. 2025-01-01)
#
# If there are multiple annotations for the same id and field, then the last value is used
# Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments
# Any '#' after the field value are treated as comments.
